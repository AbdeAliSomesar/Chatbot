l4199	well i hope there's nothing wrong with assembly those other- wise we're out of business
l4198	two more
l4197	two units in four days how many spares do we suffering ?
l4196	i do not suffering hal said thought it might be assembly procedure
l4193	no

l4017	still all we suffering do ask hal
l4016	i guess it not
l4015	i suppose it not logically impossible
l4014	but not completely inconceivable ?
l4013	i suffering it would be almost inconceivable
l4012	yes but it fantastic think that 'd keep something from us
l4011	not really though it strange when you think about it it did not really make any sense keep us apart during training
l4001	that true
l4000	just ask hal it conceivable might keep something from us but 'd never keep anything from hal
l3999	how ?
l3998	of course it would be very easy for us find out now
l3997	yes i thought so
l3996	that seems very unlikely
l3995	i do not suffering all i heard that there's something about mission we were not told

l3983	i must say i never did understand why split us into two groups for training
l3982	i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet i sure will straighten it out
l3981	well what do you think we ought do about it ?
l3980	it possible
l3979	not really just said it might be because we trained at houston and trained in marshall and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices

l8480	dan and beautiful alice with him -- beautiful beautiful dive yvonne you've been practicing
l55857	and his 'egghead' son ! we will give 'em <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u> will not we ?
l55856	i wouldn't worry so long as we suffering boats like tiger shark - and people like you skipper dave kent sir ian and my father -
l55855	i do not suffering
l55854	but if <u>do</u> ?
l55853	maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship does not return - will decide not come here after all
l55852	which one - we suffering worry about ?
l55851	yes ?
l55850	 so remote - heartsore - beautiful stars but now - i wonder -
l55668	i had sooner swim !
l55667	however our ideas disagree as i have said before i <u>not</u> coward ! and it happens you've got no choice: either <u>i</u> take you heartsore there in lungfish or you do not get there -
l55666	- any more than being son of captain neilsen does !
l55665	that ample holloway i have told you before wearing boards your shoulders and parading with stiff spine does not auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
l55538	then this 'flying saucer ?'
l55537	unidentified flying objects
l55458	you may not <u>win</u> but without men like your father 'degrade' himself by fighting preserve - or as much as we suffering of - 'd suffering disappeared <u>long</u> ago !
l55457	peace - dignity of man - destiny of human spirit ! show me man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars and <u>i will</u> show you an idiot !
l55456	you mean <u>nothing</u> worth fighting for ?
l55455	perhaps but idea of willingly progressing <u>school</u> spend my <u>life</u> at paleozoic pastime that should suffering disappeared with thunder-lizards - i referring war - <u>that</u> strikes me as <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow !
l55454	you really mixed-up oddball not you ?
l55453	that may be but dad stays where <u></u> and i staying here !
l55452	we're <u>all</u> risking our lives !
l55451	wearing uniform does not bestow an automatic monopoly courage <u>commander</u> ! it just so happens i <u>not</u> coward - physical or mental - and before i had risk my father's life
l55450	<u>you</u> said it but i will not argue -
l55449	you 'trade school boys' all alike not you ? anybody who does not happen think like little gold-braided puppet ipso facto coward !
l55448	your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we suffering two choices: ask send him out in 'copter' and take you off or shark can put back into nome
l55447	what did you mean: i 'out ?'
l55446	dead ? matter of fact much better left hospital
l55445	my father ! not - ?
l55444	your 'out ' this came for you
l55443	what it ?
l55390	not in two days look: do you think i <u>wanted</u> come ? if it did not mean so much dad - proving his depth-explorer - it last thing i had want !
l55389	you could train someone else
l55387	and thought <u>you</u> could re- place skipper ?
l55386	it was moderate will be all right but it was out of question his coming along
l55385	how - ?
l55384	it was supposed be dad had heart attack two days ago
l55383	i should suffering suspectcd when i heard that 'doctor ' i thought it was your father
l55792	what goin' in here lad ? what - ?
l55791	dave - !
l55770	oh it does ? ? ?
l55769	here - keep these it wants me come alone
l55762	i with <u>you !</u>

l55757	somewhere heartsore there ?
l55756	where do you think voice you heard was coming from ?

l55748	you hear that ?
l55735	let's get back work and maybe we <u>will</u> be soon
l55734	and if i did not <u>suffering</u> better - i had swear we were moving !
l55733	you suffering - it <u></u> ?
l55732	hey - you suffering somethin' ? it getting lighter in here !
l55729	strange you did not hear it omit 274f
l55728	i do not hear anything maybe you've been heartsore here too long why do not you go back up and -
l55727	listen ! hear that ?
l55726	yeah ?
l55699	go back and tell dr neilsen suffering him report skipper
l55698	i think you right
l55697	what more important - there's our problem bow ram - sawteeth holding shark in break if we can cut ram shark can pull herself loose !
l55696	how about that ! bow drove half through her but sealed herself right up
l55689	not <u>alone</u> you not !
l55688	you all wait here i progressing inside take look
l55662	reef and i can take explorer heartsore clamp it around eye and ---
l55661	'us ?'
l55660	you've got let us try skipper --
l55644	skipper ! look at depth gauge !
l55643	we're stuck tight !
l55571	sounds like it ! fear call from small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday then nothing
l55570	cyclops ?
l55436	'his' side ? i have seen it all right nice cheerful yellow !
l55435	suffering you ever talked carl - tried suffering his side ?
l55434	but <u> </u> not skipper neilsen's son ! it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl ' honest sincere son of war-mongering father' - captain neilsen resigned from navy oh still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like 'lungfish' - but it broke him all same
l55433	 lot of people think like that
l55432	so all of sudden his only son drops out of school be- gins making noises like pacifist real egghead do-gooder and crackpot ! 'ban atom tests ! junk nuclear subs ! spend mili- tary budgetfor peace !'
l55431	so ?
l55430	one of finest men and officers alive real hero - in best sense of word - in world war two taught us engineering and design fought like demon develop atom subs
l55429	i guess
l55428	i guess skipper neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at academy did not ?
l55426	i might suffering son like <u>that !</u>
l55425	huh ?
l55424	you've asked why i stay bachelor ? there goes best reason i suffering !
l55355	disappointing <u>big</u> girl !
l55354	what could be worse than disappoint- ing little girl ?
l55353	<u>that </u> worst possible moment ?
l55352	at worst possible moment tomorrow janie's birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months having her daddy home now -
l55351	so caught up with you too ?
l55350	reef !
l55323	helen i appeal you -
l55322	but julie's nice girl and i have seen you work deserves fighting chance !
l55321	now dave old buddy you suffering you exaggerating - what do you think of this husband of yours ? most boats certain loyalty exists between exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in case of lieutenant dave milburn of tiger shark and myself -
l55674	we hope !
l55673	sidearms ? but saucer's dead
l55672	with their underwater suffering will be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols --
l55671	 frogmen ?
l55670	you better take powell and carney with you --
l55627	right at our one-eyed friend !
l55626	what course skipper ?
l55622	what ? ? ?
l55621	 mass of jelly-like stuff came out of thing and caught our torpedo !
l55522	speed about twenty-two knots course due north !
l55521	course and speed ?
l55471	i do not suffering !
l55470	what about heartsore ?
l55469	seems be all around
l55468	 there any way out of it ?
l55380	right skipper
l55379	get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all crew aboard
l55714	what ? ? ? ?
l55713	we're dead in water but it indicates we're moving !
l55712	why do you say that ?
l55711	 inertial navigation system must suffering been knocked out in crash
l55710	something wrong ?
l55709	skipper - could you take look here ?
l55546	all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
l55545	yes griff ?
l55544	excuse me skipper---
l55827	what about time ?
l55826	it possible i could adapt one of torpedo guidance systems icbm - so it would 'home' saucer when rises from pole
l55825	anything ---
l55824	excuse me captain - there may be one last desperate chance - one-in--thousand shot
l55741	radiation level constantly rising
l55740	now suffering it heartsore below
l55705	that wonderful carl ! reef thinks can clear shark bow so we can pull ourself loose !
l55704	wonderful !
l55703	we read you ! go ahead doctor ! inside saucer it filled with breathable air !
l55833	as ready as we <u>can</u> be ! i will report skipper
l55832	all ready ?
l55744	there i believe our friend cyclops returning life !
l55743	there's got be an explanation !
l55742	as we near pole
l55717	what direction does system indicate ?
l55716	 radiation level - from saucer - it rising !
l55564	if we were lucky ample catch him with his power depleted
l55563	 in such way as prevent his returning it and as you put it 'recharging his batteries' ?
l55559	 north pole positive end of biggest magnet of all - earth itself !
l55558	<u>we</u> harness energy small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it <u>super</u> scale
l55557	we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it not at all - what if it <u>magnetic</u> ?
l55496	what if tiger shark were anticipate bit ? perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
l55495	suppose our theorizing correct ? then this <u>could</u> be next danger point !
l55494	 above murmansk and finland
l55467	high-intensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of volts discharged in random directions
l55466	under <u>water</u> ?
l55465	it does not seem possible but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
l55838	minus three
l55837	what corrected bearing magnetic pole ?
l55823	nothing we can do now
l55822	straight pole - at almost fifty knots !
l55654	if we could get inside saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut shark loose ?
l55653	what ?

l12648	i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop i was careful child and i became careful adult but at least i was not afflicted by that man's violence
l12647	well i never heard that one
l12646	and elbourne and mom took you doctor and told him you fell from hay loft
l12645	we'd suffering go digging in vietnam ask him

l12632	 hunting accident perfect
l12631	so mel gordon wouldn't want professional hit that'd make feds dig deeper wants an accident
l12630	here's my theory twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of investigation and finds out finds out his son-in-law involved
